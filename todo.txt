Going through Exercises
+ PID & PPID
  + getppid
    # Will probably be a counter for processes
  + Max value of process ID
    # Might need to include this as a macros to restart the process count
+ Arguments
  + 0-av
    # had to iterate without ac. Might be useful later...
  + prompt.c
    # uses getline() function to accept user input and write to a buffer
  + 2-Arg.c
    # uses the strtok() function probably to split a string to an array. This is a method for iterating an array up to a delimiter. Useful function for parsing through arguments.
+ Executing a program
  # No exercises but relatively easy to understand how to use it. Upon execution with execve(), the rest of file is not read.
